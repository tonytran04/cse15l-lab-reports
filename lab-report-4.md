I login by ssh my cse15L account then I copy pasted my account password to login by pressing cmd+v.

# 2. Clone the fork of the repository
clone the repository by typing the command
```
git clone " "
```
# 3. Run the failed test
```
cd l<tab><enter>
```
```
bash t<tab><enter>
```
By utilizing "cd l + tab," I  navigated to the lab7 directory Similarly, executing "bash t + tab" promptly initiated the test.sh file within lab 7, thanks to the autocompletion recognizing it as the only file starting with a "t" 

# 4. Edit the code file 
```
vim L<tab>.<tab><enter>
```
```
43jexi2<esc>:wq<enter>
```

+ vim L + tab + . + tab allows me to open up ListExamples.java

+ L + tab allows me to autofill to ListExamples  

+ 43j jumps down 43 spaces to the error line 

+ e jumps to the end of the first word with an error

+ x deletes the number there while i2 inserts 2.

+ esc allows for typing 

+ :wq saves the file enter inputs

# 5. Run the tests
```
<up><up><enter>
```
up arrow twice gets me the command in my history then pressing enter to use the command.

# 6. Commit and push

```
```
git commit -m "message"<enter>
```
```
