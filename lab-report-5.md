# Part 1 – Debugging Scenario

## Original Student Post :

**What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?**

PC Windows Visual Studio Code Terminal

**Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.**

Struggling on how to compile and run Array Tests.

**Detail the failure-inducing input and context. That might mean any or all of the command you're running, a test case, command-line arguments, working directory, even the last few commands you ran. Do your best to provide as much context as you can.**

I am not sure what to do, I did not change the code at all and followed the directions?



# Part 2 - Reflection

This quarter I learned how to do a bunch of commands that would save me time. For example, grep, wc, bash, etc... These commands that I learned are very efficient when coding and debugging. At first I was struggling and confused on how to use these codes in my assignemnts but slowly incorporating them. I will definitely make sure to use these commands in future coding classes.
